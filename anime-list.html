<p>During corona period, I was bored to do study and their was nothing to do beside exercise. I didn`t know what anime was. I used to watch dragon ball but I thought it was just a cartoon in form of uniqe graphics and story.<br>
But one day I asked a friend if he watched dragon ball.He denied.He told me its too long to watch.Also that anime dont have a good story. I further asked what he meaned by anime. so he told me about that. Thats how I discover anime. It has huge collection and varity.HE gave some suggestion like <i> baki, sword art online,darling in franxx etc.</i><br>
Now 1.5y passed, I wathched plenty of anime and don't feel excitement like before . It's like short a time recreation thing and I enjoy that ocationally.</p>

  <h4><img src="img\63586.jpg" class="D1"/><br><bold>Dragon Ball series</bold></h4> <!--here i described about dragon ball-->
<p><i>First of all, let's talk about my experince about DB.<br>
During my childhood,I usually watch Dragon ball on CN<sup>tm</sup>(cartoon network).I couldn't understand a single word but loved It's fist fight scenes.<em>Its main charcter is goku and side charcter vegeta.They grow strong like crazy achive many transformation.Many animator and manga creator are inspired about transformation by it.There are many strong character like yamacha(strongest human),picolo,gohan,jiren and freeza(main villain).</i></p>
<p>The main source of energy is called ki energy. <abbr title="Dragon ball">DB</abbr> charcter use various technices by channelig it.Like goku use <abbr title="powerful massive ki laser">kamahamaha</abbr> as his special attack . Vegata use <abbr title="powerful ki bomb">big bang attack</abbr>  . There are many kind of tranformation differ by species.Sayajin race use super sayajin transformation(ss1,ss2,ss3,ss4) and sayjin god transformation(red and blue).Those transformation boost their power level to extream.Their are many other technices like <abbr title="boost power to x times but drain stamina x times faster">kaioken</abbr>,<abbr title="use limbs with with extream accuracy and utilise strength with minimum waste without thinking.All operate subconsiously.">ultra instinct</abbr>, hakai or destroyer etc.</p>
<p>This anime series was good till dragon ball gt(1996). But after that this anime series is ruined according to me. It doesn't follow good story line and lost logic,just jump in battle.Overall I pointout some cons and perks and listed below.
    <ol title="1">
        <li>Good story till DB GT</li>
        <li>Extraordinery fist fight scenes</li>
        <li>Power level described well with transformation. </li>
        <li>Rivalary system</li>
        <li>Children friendly cause it just represent matrial arts and dont have any 18+ scenes or lewd dialogues. </li>
        <li>Fascinating background music</li>
        <li>power scale is confusing. Like jiren stronger then many gods of destraction but goku dominated him at peak of his strength with ultra instict despite goku's ill conditon. Moreover goku mastered UI in 40min though many gods couldnt achived sign <abbr title="ultra instinct">UI</abbr> form with thousends years of traning .</li>
        <li>Author didnt focused on Z fighters character development.</li>
        <li>Need good story and plot in upcoming series.</li>

<h4><img src="img\746117.jpg" class="D1"/><br>Sword art online series</h4>
<p>Its a unique issakai anime.MC use gaming console to conect with issekai world.That console use some kind of nerv system that connect brain with Artificial computer world.People can experience enviroment and do things thats impossible to do in real world.But after some time a progammed was made by creator that blocked people in game . They have to clear all the 100floor.<br>
Mc and some other character had some kind of vip card . They are also good at mmorpg type game.There are many class like sword,lance,katana,knucle,bow, staff,magic device and gun user.Also sub class are exist like samurai,paladin,knight,theif,wizard,ninja,dual sword user,assasian,matrial artist,dancer and etc.There are also profession class like black smith and alchemist etc.<b>There are list given below about my likes and dislikes .</b>
