      <p>Its a dark anime and one of my favorite.of my friend suggest me after.It has violation, complecated story as well as enriched story,adult scenes and etc.But author had died before finish it and its matter of sorrow that masterpice was unfinished.The mc was a normal guy with having some kind of phobia.When he was kid he had to do mercencery job and bear other baggage to maintain his livelhood. Many thing happend durring his journey.I dont wanna spoil the fun you should watch it. Some perks and cons are given below.
